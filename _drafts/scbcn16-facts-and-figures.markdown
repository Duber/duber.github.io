Here are some facts and figures about past Software Craftsmanship Barcelona 2016 (SCBCN16) that I thought could be interesting to share:

\<INSERT HERE ORGANIZERS PICTURES\>

We were 4-8 organizers. By this I mean that while a group of four remained fully committed all the time, eight of us participated at some point.

Organization meetings took place online (hangouts) weekly starting from February.
Furthermore, this was the first year that meetings were publicly announced so anyone interested could attend.
Although we didn't get lots of new faces, in my opinion the experience was positive.

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. From the community to the community
SCBCN is the only event I know where organizers and speakers pay for their tickets as any other attendee.

The reason is that until this year we didn't have any sponsor and it was the easiest way to organize it. We simply divided the expected expenses of the event by the attendance.
<br/>Overtime this has become a trademark of the event and a guarantee of genuine interest for everyone.

Still, we are working on it and hopefully at some point it won't be necessary.

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. Tickets
Because past year tickets sold out during the first three days and some core members couldn't get their tickets, this year we tried to increase the chances that everyone could get one by selling them in two batches: one in July and the rest in September.

The idea was great but we didn't anticipate the demand and tickets sold out during the first seconds of each batch.

Even though high demand may seem nice, I feel discomforted about this and I hope we will find a solution for next year.

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. Waitlist
After selling out, we setup a waitlist in order to provided a fair way of opening new tickets and to measure the dimension of the demand.

Last time I checked there were more than 100 people at waitlist.

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. Attendees and speakers in numbers
We were 84 attendees from which 25 (~30%) were also speakers.

We had two speakers cancel their session after being accepted (which we replaced), one of them days before the conference.
Another two attendees couldn't make it.

Surprisingly, around 40% of attendees were new-comers, although not all were unknown to the community. Still, it exceeded our expectations given the difficulty to get yourself a ticket.

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. Web page
This year we renewed the website and moved from [wordpress](https://wordpress.com) to [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

On a funny note, most of the work was made by [Carlos](https://github.com/carlosb1), who didn't have much experience on web development. So kudos to him for that :)

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. T-shirts
The first edition of SCBCN had a t-shirt that, although very basic (just some words on the back), I had envy all these years :3
<br/>This edition not only we got a t-shirt but we got it for free thanks to a sponsor.

They were generously designed by [Laura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurapolls), who made 3 prototypes:

The anecdote occurred during the printing, when we noticed a terrible yet typical mistake in the spelling of <i>Craftmanship</i> instead of <i>Craftsmanship</i>.
We ended up reprinting those.

We plan on giving away extra t-shirts on local events. Do you fancy one ?

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. Sponsors
It was the first year with sponsors
We rejected more sponsors than we accepted.
Official sponsors:
* Netmind
* Letgo
* Vistaprint
* Schibsted
* Mosaic

Unnoficial sponsors:
* Smoking Brains
* Codely.tv

We tried to grow by looking for a bigger venue but it didn't happen. We lost a great deal of work onto that.
