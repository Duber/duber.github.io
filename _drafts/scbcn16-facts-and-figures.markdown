Here are some facts and figures about past Software Craftsmanship Barcelona 2016 (SCBCN16) that I thought could be interesting to share:

### {% assign index = 1 %}{{ index }}. Organizers
We were 4-8 organizers. That means that while a group of four remained fully committed all the time, eight of us participated at some point.

Meetings were publicly announced so anyone interested could attend. They took place online through hangouts and occurred weekly starting from February.

This was the first year that the meetings were announced and, in my opinion, the experience was positive. Although we didn't get lots of new faces, we definitely didn't lose anything.

The organizers, listed in no particular order, were:

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. Tickets
SCBCN is the only event I know where organizers and speakers pay for their tickets as any other attendee.

This is a controversial point that always surprises first-time speakers. The main reason is economical since SCBCN is non-profit but it has become part of its culture as well.
<br/>This is not to say that we are not working on it and hopefully at some point it won't be necessary.

Because past year tickets sold out during the first three days and some core members couldn't get their tickets, this year we tried to increase the chances that everyone could get one by selling them in two batches: one in July and the other in September.
The idea was great but we didn't anticipate the demand.

Tickets sold out during the first seconds of each batch.

Even though high demand may seem nice, I am genuinely disgusted about this and I hope we will find a solution for next year.

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. Waitlist
Because of the demand we decided to setup a waitlist after the last batch of tickets sold out. This accomplished two purposes: provided a fair way of opening new tickets and helped us gauge the dimension of the demand.

Last time I checked it there were more than 100 people at waitlist.

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. Attendees and speakers
We were 84 attendees from which 25 (~30%) were also speakers.

We had two speakers cancel their session after being accepted (which we replaced), one of them days before the conference.
Another two attendees couldn't make it.

Surprisingly, around 40% of attendees were new-comers, although not all were unknown to the community. Still, it is way more than I expected given the difficulty to get yourself a ticket.

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. Web page
This year we renewed the website and moved from [wordpress](https://wordpress.com) to [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

On a funny note, most of the work was made by [Carlos](https://github.com/carlosb1), who didn't have much experience on web development. So kudos to him for that :)

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. T-shirts
The first edition of SCBCN had a t-shirt that, although very basic (just some words on the back) I had envy all these years :3
<br/>Finally, this edition we managed

They were designed by [Laura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurapolls). She made 3 models, from which we picked the

We fucked up with t-shirts
We noticed while during printing and had to reprint some of them.

We plan to give away extra t-shirts on local events. Do you fancy one ?

### {% assign index = index | plus:1 %}{{ index }}. Sponsors
It was the first year with sponsors
We rejected more sponsors than we accepted.
Official sponsors:
* Netmind
* Letgo
* Vistaprint
* Schibsted
* Mosaic

Unnoficial sponsors:
* Smoking Brains
* Codely.tv

We tried to grow by looking for a bigger venue but it didn't happen. We lost a great deal of work onto that.
