Software Craftsmanship Barcelona 2016 (SCBCN16) has taken place this past weekend and I thought it would be interesting to throw some numbers about the event:

### {% increment index %}. Organizers and speakers paid their ticket
I don't know any other event where this happens. Hopefully at some point this won't be necessary.

### {% increment index %}. We had 84 attendees

### {% increment index %}. We had 25 speakers
Which counts for and impressive 30% of attendees.
### {% increment index %}. The web page was made by a non-front-end developer
Kudos to Carlos.
### {% increment index %}. T-shirts were made by Laura polls (designer). She made 3 models.
Love
### {% increment index %}. It was the first year with sponsors

### {% increment index %}. We rejected more sponsors than we accepted.
See {{ index | minus:2 }}.
### {% increment index %}. There was more than 100 people at waitlist.
For whom I felt sorry.
### {% increment index %}. We had two speakers cancel their session after being accepted (which we replaced). One of them days before the conference.
### {% increment index %}. We tried to grow by looking for a bigger venue but it didn't happen. We lost a great deal of work onto that.

### {% increment index %}. We had 5 official sponsors and two unofficial
Official sponsors:
* Netmind
* Letgo
* Vistaprint
* Schibsted
* Mosaic

Unnoficial sponsors:
* Smoking Brains
* Codely.tv

### {% increment index %}. We had 2 attendees who couldn't make it

### {% increment index %}. We were 5-7 organizers, not all equally committed. Meeting online, remote. Only met once irl except for some meetings with venues

* Cristina
* Carlos
* Javi
* Me
* Jose
* √Ålvaro

### {% increment index %}. Around 40% attendees were new-comers

### {% increment index %}. Tickets sold out during the first minute
It's not as cool as it may seem. I am genuinely disgusted about this.
### {% increment index %}. We fucked up with t-shirts
We noticed while during printing and had to reprint some of them.
